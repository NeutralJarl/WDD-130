                <h1>Welcome To the Fat Cat Cafe! Famfrit Goblet Ward 13 Plot 42 Friday - Sunday 5pm - 8pm pst</h1>

                <p>This website will be used to show a unique side of the online gaming community that many would find fantastical and odd. One of the more popular games out there in the MMORPG genre at the moment is Final Fantasy XIV, a game where hardcore raiding and world first attempts are made and Ultimate raids can take months to complete, but not everyone playing the game is simply a raiding fiend. Many players choose to spend their time instead on a more relaxed playful and immersive experience of role playing. These types of players use their characters as a tool to engage in different scenarios where they effectively are their character and choose to venture to various fun venues put up by other players. As odd as this may seem, there is a large following for this type of amusement, and the purpose of this site is to expose people not familiar with such a style of gameplay to a good example of what it can be like in a casual environment. You may be wondering such things as, what type of places can I go? Who would I see there? What opportunities to do fun things can I find there? All of these sorts of questions will be answered for the specific example of The Fat Cat Caf√©, an actual in game venue that was kind enough to let me document an experience there!</p>
