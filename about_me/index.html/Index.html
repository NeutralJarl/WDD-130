    <h2>Spencer</h2>
    <h3>or Spence, IDK it doesn't really matter</h3>
    <p>Hey I'm Spencer, I'm working on a Computer Science degree, and I like video games, rock climbing, diving, and tennis!</p>
    <p>I'm single and just a student at the moment, no job. I was born in the Church, and as such have been a member my whole life. I live in Washington, it's quite green and peaceful here (would recommend) and hopefully im working towards a server management job or data analysis or quite possible writing code for a company!</p>
    <p>Who knows, I'm less concerned with the work, than I am the environment around me and my conditions. </p>
    <p>Ignore that there isn't a photo, I could not for the life of me get it to load for some reason, but there is the little icon showing i tried!</p>
